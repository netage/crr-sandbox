      <h2>Introduction</h2>
     <p>
        Modern fire service agencies engage in many activities beyond responding to fires or even other types of emergencies. Many fire service agencies actively engage fire prevention and other community risk reduction ("CRR") activities as part of their comprehensive, all-hazards mitigation and response, capabilities. While many fire service agencies conduct these types of activities, there appears to be little consistency in how these activities are documented or what types of data are created.

      <h2>Audience</h2>
     <p>
	 The overall goal of this project is to develop a prototype data model. The National Fire Data System being developed by NFPA is expanded for quality local and national data for CRR decision making. The project will convene subject matter experts from the enforcer, public education, CRR, codes & standards, and data communities to identify current best practices and existing data formats to develop a scalable, flexible, CRR data model.

                    <p>CoSAT Program&#39;s goal is to combine home fire safety and provide social help for low-income households. Success:
					<ul>
						<li>Number of alarms installed</li> 
						<li>The number of needs identified and met</li>				
						<li>The number of hazards identified and mitigated</li>							
					</ul>
					CoSAT targets small pockets of neglected residents&#45;in this case mobile home parks, which they noted are often known as &ldquo;resource deserts&rdquo;. To deal with this small sample size; CoSAT uses a concept of micro-communities, which emphasizes community perceptions in addition to call data. The strong anecdotal evidence from the communities is that this program made them feel safer in their homes, increased their knowledge, and built their trust in the fire department. CoSAT volunteers reported all feedback.
					The call data, although limited, supports the anecdotal data. 12.4% of homes canvassed made an emergency call in the 150 days after a CoSAT event and 10% of those homes suffered a fire. Of homes that used CoSAT services, only 1.1% made an emergency call and zero of those were fires.

            <section class="method">
                    <h4 class="subhead" id="method">How is the project organized?</h4>
                    <p>The pre-event formative evaluation was a geographic, qualitative smoke-alarm targeting. We knew the targeted homes were older and in low-income areas. The mobile home parks targeted exist outside city limits which mean fewer resources are available to these residents. The age of homes and their place in a resource-desert meant that very few of these homes would have working alarms. Low-income households often lack the means to get these without aid.
						This pre-event evaluation identified nine parks, comprising 266 homes. During these events, social work students from Colorado State University&#39;s School of Social Work conducted an informal, in-person assessment of the residents in the home. Their task was to identify needs the resident has, beyond smoke alarms. Rather than applying a limiting model to this conversation, we allowed the residents to self-identify their biggest need(s). This second formative evaluation guided our follow-up efforts with these residents.

				<h4 class="subhead" id="possible-approach-to-implementation">Which CRR activity/activities do you employ?</h4>
				<p>The Community Service Action Teams (CoSAT) program do house visits. First visit:
				<ol>
					<li>Install smoke alarm</li>
					<li>Give fire safety instructions</li>
					<li>Identify resident needs</li>
					<li>Inform on help initiatives. All CoSAT members are debriefed after each event to guide future events. They identified a need for more in-home resources. Second visit within 2 weeks.</li>
					<li>Meet needs identified. CoSAT responds to needs identified by the community. As such, it is undergoing constant evaluation. As needs come from the community, we identify local resources to meet them. Some identified needs included winter clothing, food assistance, utility assistance, and employment help. These resources are blended into future CoSAT events, resulting in an ever-growing resource-bank.
					All CoSAT members are debriefed after each event to guide future events. They identified a need for more in-home resources. At the first event, they were given a home-assessment form to get basic contact information and record needs. As our resource bank grew, CoSAT teams now carry backpacks of brochures and other materials.

					<p>
					Minnesota Department of Public Safety&#39;s State Fire Marshal Division has reported on Youth-Set Fires. The purpose for identifying these children is to offer intervention services so that they will learn the dangers of setting fires and stop the behavior. Minnesota has a statewide network of regional youth fire intervention specialists. When a child is referred to one of the regions, the regional program manager initiates contact with the family. A youth fire intervention specialist visits with the family and uses a standard actuarial (answers are numerically weighted) assessment tool to determine the child&#39;s intervention needs. The tool provides intervention direction for the high and low scoring kids. High scoring children will often be referred to mental health care. Low scoring children may simply need an educational intervention consisting of intensive fire science, prevention and safety topics. Even children who start cooking, smoking or fireworks fires will benefit from fire education.

						There has been no change in the number of fires before and after the program. The low level of occurrences makes it difficult to get an accurate gauge of the situation.

					Inspections by geographical grid instead of occupancy type
					VFD collaborated with organized labor and created a new position called Fire Code Officer (FCO). FCO is dedicated to fire code enforcement activities (inspections, permits, complaints, fireworks patrols, etc.). FCO revenue is generated from the fire inspection fee schedule. 
					All VFD records (historical building/structural files, records, fire protection systems plans and fire protection systems testing/maintenance reports, fire inspection notices, fire operational permits a.o.) are digitized, providing immediate field access.
