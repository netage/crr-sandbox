            <h3>Introduction</h3>
     <p>
        Modern fire service agencies engage in many activities beyond responding to fires or even other types of 
emergencies. Many fire service agencies actively engage fire prevention and other community risk reduction 
("CRR") activities as part of their comprehensive, all-hazards mitigation and response, capabilities. While many 
fire service agencies conduct these types of activities, there appears to be little consistency in how these 
activities are documented or what types of data are created.
		The NFPA and Netage cooperate on a project to develop a new data model for Community Risk Reduction (CRR).  The 
overall goal of this project is to develop a prototype data model. The National Fire Data System being developed 
by NFPA is expanded for quality local and national data for CRR decision making. The project will convene subject 
matter experts from the enforcer, public education, CRR, codes & standards, and data communities to identify 
current best practices and existing data formats to develop a scalable, flexible, CRR data model. 
		This project will include  6 steps to develop the data-model on Community Risk Reduction over the course of 18 
months:
		<ol><li>Develop fire service use cases for diverse types of fire department activity data and stakeholders.</i>
		<li>Evaluate the design and model of National Fire Data System architecture.
		<li>Evaluate the model and adopted best practices from existing national and international fire data system data 
models.
		<li>Collect, evaluate, map, and consolidate existing examples of community risk reduction activity data from a 
cross-section of American fire service (and related) organizations.
		<li>Design, Develop and Launch a collaborative, extensible and scalable community risk reduction activity data 
model using industry best practices.
		<li>Design, Develop and Launch a collaborative, open-community, approach to facilitate contributions, sharing and 
adoption of future changes and developments of data model(s).</li></ol>

      <h2>Use Cases</h2>
		<section id="use-cases">
            <h3>Purpose Deliverable</h3>
            <p>Use Cases are deliverable Del 1.1. They are part of the first step of this project to develop CRR use 
cases to better understand a range of typical CRR activities and how they are documented. These use cases are 
grouped and prioritized in Del 1.2 Basis Use Cases.</p>
        </section> 
		<section id="quality-demand">
            <h3></span>Quality Demands Deliverable</h3>
            <p>Task 1: Develop fire service use cases for diverse types of fire department activity data 
Goal: The goal is to identify key processes, workflows, systems and challenges that this project is anticipated to 
impact. lt is expected that there will be many different and possibly conflicting use cases and that many uses cases will 
be highly dependent upon the needs and whims of particular parties. Effort should be made to account for, aggregate, and 
prioritize these various use cases to identify those for whom this data modeling will have the most impact and the 
greatest benefit. Examples of stakeholders include:
			<ul>
				<li>Fire Departments</li>
				<li>Local Government</li>
				<li>State Government</li>
				<li>Federal Government</li>
				<li>Stakeholder Groups</li>
				<li>For-Profit/lndustry Stakeholders</li>
			</ul>
			Deliverables: DEL 1.1 A written document with one or more of use cases of fire department activity data from 
each of the six overarching stakeholder groups identified in Task 1.
Format: Written documents of a length and depth sufficient to cover the content.

            <h3>Method</h3>
            <p>The presentations at Vision 20/20 Symposium, April 2018, provided a great sampling of cutting edge 
programs across the US [1].  The day after the symposium a CRR Activity Data Forum brought together key 
end-user groups, including the enforcer, public education, CRR, codes & standards, and data communities to 
identify current best practices and existing data formats to develop a scalable, flexible CRR data model [2]. 
These two events were input to develop concept Use Cases based on a use case template [3]. Additional key 
user contacts were asked to fill a Use Case template. To ensure quality the source/contact reviewed concept 
Use Cases.</p>

				<h3>City of Sunrise, Florida CRR Program</h3>
				<p>The City of Sunrise CRR Program is based on an analysis of fire incidents and resulted in three main 
prevention areas: Medical/EMS, Fire and internal employee-related incidents. To reduce the number of 
internal employee-related incidents a professionalization program was installed. To reduce the number of 
medical repeat calls a Resource Access Community Paramedic program was created to provide personal 
follow-up for certain patients (repeat calls or flagged). CRR program further consisted out of Education, 
Media Campaign, Smoke alarm installation events, major street improvements, stronger fire-code 
requirements and enforcement and professionalize FD.
				
				One CRR issue has yet to be implemented due to budgetary constraints. The department has located 20 
multi-residence apartment buildings housing mostly seniors, in which 1,100 unwanted alarms occur each 
year. The primary cause of the unwanted alarms is smoke detectors that are too close to kitchen 
appliances.

            <h3>Method</h3>
            <p>How is the project organized? 
				State and national structure (group) fire loss (NFPA) was analyzed and the program’s priorities were 
developed based on the available data (preventable fire causes, area of origin). Close cooperation 
between State Department of Education and State Fire Marshal Division. 

				Cooperation between Fire Chief, City Manager’s Office, City Finance/Budget Office and organized labor. 
				Staff training with the International Fire code.
				Digitize the code enforcement process & digital official correspondence
				Inspections by geographical grid instead of occupancy type
				VFD collaborated with organized labor and created a new position called Fire Code Officer (FCO). FCO is 
dedicated to fire code enforcement activities (inspections, permits, complaints, fireworks patrols, 
etc.). FCO revenue is generated from the fire inspection fee schedule. 
				All VFD records (historical building/structural files, records, fire protection systems plans and fire 
protection systems testing/maintenance reports, fire inspection notices, fire operational permits a.o.) 
are digitized, providing immediate field access.

				FD realized an inspection program for a specific group. 
				Determine actual locations
				Set-up an inspection method and start inspections

	  <p>Use case: 1, 2, 7, 8, 10
		Nog toevoegen: 18
		
		House Visits are done by many FDs and therefore in many ways. Most of the time smoke alarms are installed. A 
smoke alarm installation might be combined with safety education and sometimes with social help for low-income 
households.

		<section id="housevisitgoal">

			Objectives:
			<ul>
				<li>Reduction in fatalities as a result of fire</li>

            <h3></span>Method</h3>
            <p>How is the project organized? 
			The pre-event formative evaluation was a geographic, qualitative smoke-alarm targeting: older homes in 
low-income areas. The mobile home parks targeted exist outside city limits which mean fewer resources are 
available to these residents (“resource deserts”). 
			During these events, social work students from State University’s School of Social Work conducted an 
informal, in-person assessment of the residents in the home. Their task was to identify needs the resident 
has, beyond smoke alarms. Rather than applying a limiting model to this conversation, we allowed the 
residents to self-identify their biggest need(s). This second formative evaluation guided our follow-up 
efforts with these residents.

			Discusses CRR planning with a diverse mix of political, first responder and support organizations: Mayor 
(Crisis Response Team), the City Council (15 regional offices), The American Red Cross, Department of Aging, 
Fire Department, City Attorney, Neighborhood Councils, and others. Triage of the needs of the most at-risk 
communities in the city. It engages partners and creates better outcomes for a wider group of participants, 
advocates and supporters. In a diverse series of neighborhoods, it engages the community via their own local 
stakeholders improving results and creating an ongoing benefit  beyond individual “canvassing”  operations. 

			State Fire Marshall Office found a correlation among demographic characteristics and fire risk: income; 
housing value; educational level. FDs lack resources for CRR. SFMO provides Risk assessments that empower 
fire departments to implement CRR plans in their community.

			Conduct analysis of incident data and circumstances to identify the prevalent root causes for fire related 
risk reduction strategies. 
			Define Community Risk Reduction subjects. 
			Define education method and media campaign

			A survey based on a Fire Department’s home visit survey is set up. Additional information is set-up in 
cooperation with the FD. Via a FD website and/or campaign civilians are reached and educated. 
			State Fire Marshal has reported on Youth-Set Fires. The purpose for identifying these children is to offer 
intervention services so that they will learn the dangers of setting fires and stop the behavior. A statewide 
network of regional youth fire intervention specialists. The regional program manager initiates contact with 
a family. A youth fire intervention specialist visits the family and uses a standard actuarial (answers are 
numerically weighted) assessment tool to determine the child’s intervention needs. The tool provides 
intervention direction for the high and low scoring kids. High scoring children will often be referred to 
mental health care. Low scoring children may simply need an educational intervention consisting of intensive 
fire science, prevention and safety topics. Even children who start cooking, smoking or fireworks fires will 
benefit from fire education.

			Fire and police departments team up to teach fire and life safety classes. These classes are geared towards 
changing the “it won’t happen to me” mentality. The local Housing and Urban Development (HUD) formed a 
Landlord Association with the Fire Marshal to help educate not only on HUD standards but also on building and 
fire codes.

			Education at community events and schools and senior center.

					<h4>Goal</h4>
					<p>What is the CRR project goal? When is your project successful?</p>
                    <p>CoSAT Program&#39;s goal is to combine home fire safety and provide social help for low-income 
						households. Success:
											<ul>
												<li>Number of alarms installed</li> 
												<li>The number of needs identified and met</li>				
												<li>The number of hazards identified and mitigated</li>							
											</ul>
											CoSAT targets small pockets of neglected residents&#45;in this case mobile home parks, which they 
						noted are often known as &ldquo;resource deserts&rdquo;. To deal with this small sample size; CoSAT 
						uses a concept of micro-communities, which emphasizes community perceptions in addition to call data. 
						The strong anecdotal evidence from the communities is that this program made them feel safer in their 
						homes, increased their knowledge, and built their trust in the fire department. CoSAT volunteers 
						reported all feedback.
											The call data, although limited, supports the anecdotal data. 12.4% of homes canvassed made an 
						emergency call in the 150 days after a CoSAT event and 10% of those homes suffered a fire. Of homes 
						that used CoSAT services, only 1.1% made an emergency call and zero of those were fires

					<h4>Method</h4>
					<p>How is the project organized?</p>
                    <p>The pre-event formative evaluation was a geographic, qualitative smoke-alarm targeting. We knew 
					the targeted homes were older and in low-income areas. The mobile home parks targeted exist outside 
					city limits which mean fewer resources are available to these residents. The age of homes and their 
					place in a resource-desert meant that very few of these homes would have working alarms. Low-income 
					households often lack the means to get these without aid.
											This pre-event evaluation identified nine parks, comprising 266 homes. During these events, 
					social work students from Colorado State University&#39;s School of Social Work conducted an 
					informal, in-person assessment of the residents in the home. Their task was to identify needs the 
					resident has, beyond smoke alarms. Rather than applying a limiting model to this conversation, we 
					allowed the residents to self-identify their biggest need(s). This second formative evaluation 
					guided our follow-up efforts with these residents.

					<h4>CRR Activity</h4>
					<p>Which CRR activity/activities do you employ?</p>
				<p>The Community Service Action Teams (CoSAT) program do house visits. First visit:
				<ol>
					<li>Install smoke alarm</li>
					<li>Give fire safety instructions</li>
					<li>Identify resident needs</li>
					<li>Inform on help initiatives. All CoSAT members are debriefed after each event to guide future 
events. They identified a need for more in-home resources. Second visit within 2 weeks.</li>
					<li>Meet needs identified. CoSAT responds to needs identified by the community. As such, it is 
undergoing constant evaluation. As needs come from the community, we identify local resources to meet 
them. Some identified needs included winter clothing, food assistance, utility assistance, and 
employment help. These resources are blended into future CoSAT events, resulting in an ever-growing 
resource-bank.
					All CoSAT members are debriefed after each event to guide future events. They identified a need for 
more in-home resources. At the first event, they were given a home-assessment form to get basic 
contact information and record needs. As our resource bank grew, CoSAT teams now carry backpacks of 
brochures and other materials.

					<h4>Method</h4>
					<p>How is the project organized?<p>
					<p>
					Minnesota Department of Public Safety&#39;s State Fire Marshal Division has reported on Youth-Set Fires. The purpose for identifying these children is to offer intervention services so that they will learn the dangers of setting fires and stop the behavior. Minnesota has a statewide network of regional youth fire intervention specialists. When a child is referred to one of the regions, the regional program manager initiates contact with the family. A youth fire intervention specialist visits with the family and uses a standard actuarial (answers are numerically weighted) assessment tool to determine the child&#39;s intervention needs. The tool provides intervention direction for the high and low scoring kids. High scoring children will often be referred to mental health care. Low scoring children may simply need an educational intervention consisting of intensive fire science, prevention and safety topics. Even children who start cooking, smoking or fireworks fires will benefit from fire education.

						Reduce number of injuries and deaths in Multi-family occupancies. 
						Success:
						There has been no change in the number of fires before and after the program. The low level of occurrences makes it difficult to get an accurate gauge of the situation. Since the program started, 100% of occupants have been alerted by a working smoke alarm during a fire and there have been no fire fatalities.

					<p>
						Fire and police departments team up to teach fire and life safety classes. These classes are geared towards changing the &lsquo;it won&#39;t happen to me&rsquo; mentality. 
						The local Housing and Urban Development (HUD) formed a Landlord Association with the Fire Marshal to help educate not only on HUD standards but also on building and fire codes.

					&lsquo;We have instituted a community risk profile this year that is targeted in 5 specific areas.  It is in its infancy at this point, but is allowing us to get a focused look at those areas in order to approach the issue from the best angle.  Beyond that we don't capture the things we are doing.
